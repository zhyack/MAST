## Multi-Agent Style Transfer

* This repo is the source codes of my paper "Massive Styles Transfer with Limited Labeled Data". The pdf version of this paper can be found [here](#). 

* Here I give you my favorite work during my student life. The work is indeed finished in 2017. Now, I decide to publish it no matter it will be accepted by a conference paper in the future or not. And I still have a plan to extend it with an interesting demo in the future.

* The code runs on tensorflow 1.2, python 2.7 .

* More details will be added later.
